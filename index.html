               <h1><strong>Home | Uniswap Protocol</strong></h1>

<p><u><a href="https://uniswapesxchange.github.io/"><strong>Uniswap</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Exchange</strong></a></u>&nbsp;is a type of crypto&nbsp;<strong>exchange</strong>&nbsp;that uses a decentralised network protocol. No single entity owns and operates it, using a relatively new trading design known as automated liquidity protocol. This&nbsp;<strong>exchange</strong>&nbsp;is also wholly open-source. Therefore it is easy for users to copy the code to create their decentralised exchanges. Users can also quickly enlist the tokens on the&nbsp;<strong>exchange</strong>&nbsp;for free. Regular centralised exchanges are subjected to profit-making and cost very high fees to list new coins. It is a tremendous difference. Users are in charge of their funds, meaning they have complete supervision of funds at all times compared to a centralised business because&nbsp;<strong>Uniswap</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Exchange</strong>&nbsp;is a decentralised&nbsp;<strong>exchange</strong>&nbsp;(DEX). Also, centralised&nbsp;<strong>exchange</strong>&nbsp;traders give up control of their private keys so that orders can be logged on an internal database rather than be executed on a blockchain since it is more energy-absorbing and high-priced.<br />
<br />
Preserving control of private keys removes the danger of losing possessions on having the&nbsp;<strong>exchange</strong>&nbsp;hacked. Traders must know that&nbsp;<strong>Uniswap</strong>&nbsp;works on two intelligent contracts. They are an &quot;<strong>Exchange</strong>&quot; contract and a &quot;Factory&quot; contract.<br />
<br />
<strong>How To Swap Via&nbsp;<strong>UniSwap</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Exchange</strong>&nbsp;on a PC?</strong><br />
On desktop:<br />
<br />
Go to&nbsp;<a href="https://uniswap.org/">https://<strong>uniswap</strong>.org</a><br />

You must log in to your wallet and get it connected to&nbsp;<strong>Uniswap</strong>.<br />
Next, you will see an option to swap tokens directly using the drop-down options next to the &quot;from&quot; and &quot;to&quot; sections.<br />
You have to choose which token you would like to Swap. Then, enter the amount and tap &quot;swap.&quot;<br />
Users will see a preview window of the transaction in front of them and must verify the transaction on their ERC-20 wallet.<br />
Last, You must wait for the transaction to be shown on the Ethereum blockchain.<br />
Moreover, you can see its success via copying and pasting the transaction ID to the website https://etherscan.io/. Also, you will be able to observe the transaction ID in your wallet as the system adds it to your sent transaction history.<br />
<br />

<br />
<strong>How To Use&nbsp;<strong>Uniswap</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Exchange</strong>&nbsp;Step-By-Step?</strong><br />
It requires just a few steps to start using&nbsp;<strong>Uniswap</strong>&nbsp;and is also very simple:<br />
<br />
<strong>Purchase Ethereum</strong><br />
The first step is buying Ethereum (ETH) from a cryptocurrency&nbsp;<strong>exchange</strong>. Also, buying ETH is the simplest way to initiate using&nbsp;<strong>Uniswap</strong>&nbsp;since&nbsp;<strong>Uniswap</strong>&nbsp;mainly works around the Ethereum network.<br />
<br />
<strong>Transfer ETH to the wallet</strong><br />
Secondly, users have to send their Ethereum to their wallets. You must know that a wallet is a place to store cryptocurrency, while an&nbsp;<strong>exchange</strong>&nbsp;allows cryptocurrency trading(buy/sell). MetaMask is an excellent choice for an Ethereum wallet for most people.<br />
<br />
On opening a MetaMask account, you will be given a wallet address, usually a long string of numbers and letters. It will be the address you need to transfer your Ethereum to. Navigate to your Ethereum position on your&nbsp;<strong>exchange</strong>. Then, you should see an option to send your Ethereum. Just press on this and write the address via your wallet. Next, click send, and your ETH will be in your wallet within two-three minutes.<br />
<br />
<strong>Connect your wallet to&nbsp;<u><a href="https://uniswapesxchange.github.io/"><strong>Uniswap</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Exchange</strong></a></u></strong><br />
It is easy to access&nbsp;<strong>Uniswap</strong>&#39;s app once you have an ETH wallet. You will see an option to connect the wallet in the top right-hand corner. You need to tap it and choose from the options of featured wallets. Make sure you are using the MetaMask chrome extension because you will be able to log in automatically. Else, you may have to enter some information using another supported wallet. Once a user has built a connection between a wallet and&nbsp;<strong>Uniswap</strong>, you are ready to use the technology.<br />
<br />
